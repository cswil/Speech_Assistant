# Speech_Assistant

This is a multi-functional speech assistant that when i have the time will add and update functions for.

## Installation

You need pyaudio, SpeecgRecognition, pyttsx3
```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio # couldnt get pyaudio with just pip on my pc so had to use pipwin 
pip install SpeechRecognition 
pip install pyttsx3
```

## Usage

Just run it, if you want it to just repeat what you say to it then comment out the gettemp() line and it will repeat what you said (as of 02/12/2019) more functionality will be added
If you want a temperature just say the place you want 
## Contributing
I am limited for time between school work and programming so if anyone wants to implement modules to work with this I would be delighted.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate though (no broken code please).

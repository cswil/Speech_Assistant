# Speech_Assistant

This is a multi-functional speech assistant that when i have the time will add and update functions for.

## Installation

You need pyaudio, SpeecgRecognition, pyttsx3

```
or
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Current commands :

*tell me a chuck norris joke - tells a chuck norris joke

*what is the temperature in x - fetches temperature. you need to register to openweathermap and put your api key in

more will be added

## Contributing
I am limited for time between school work and programming so if anyone wants to implement modules to work with this I would be delighted.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate though (no broken code please).
